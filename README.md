BEPS Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the British Election Panel Study (BEPS) dataset (BEPS_extracted.csv) through structured data exploration and visualization techniques. The notebook walks through the complete data analysis workflow, from loading the dataset to generating insights using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate methods.

Dataset

The dataset contains survey responses including demographic details, political preferences, and opinions on various political and economic topics.

Key columns include:

vote – Political party preference

age – Respondent’s age

economic.cond.national – Perceived national economic conditions

economic.cond.household – Perceived household economic conditions

Ratings for key politicians (Blair, Hague, Kennedy)

Europe – Views on European integration

political.knowledge – Political knowledge score

gender – Respondent’s gender

Tasks Performed

Data Loading – Import and preview dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Dataset dimensions and summary statistics

Missing value detection and handling

Data cleaning for consistency

Univariate Analysis – Distribution plots and frequency counts.

Bivariate Analysis – Correlation analysis and cross-tabulations.

Multivariate Analysis – Relationship visualization using heatmaps, scatter plots, and grouped bar charts.

Visualization – Using matplotlib and seaborn for clear and interpretable plots.

Tools & Libraries

Python 3

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

NumPy – Numerical operations

Objective

To explore and understand the BEPS dataset, identify patterns and relationships among variables, and visualize key political and demographic trends.
